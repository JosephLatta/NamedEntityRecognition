# NamedEntityRecognition
Hidden Markov Model for Named Entity Recognition

This python program marks word tokens as a Person, Organization, Location, or Other.
The training data must have a special format, see train.txt for an example.
HMM_NER_2.py contains the hidden markov model implementation and trains the data.
Run the script and the result is put into output1.txt (see this file to understand format).
